    <div class="column colspan-3 quote"> <h2 class="text-left">DevOps gave us an edge</h2> 
        <div class="text-left"> <p>“DevOps has helped us do very frequent releases, giving us an edge on time to market. We are now able to make daily product releases as opposed to 6-month releases, and push fixes to our customers in a span of a few hours.”</p> 
        <p>— Hamesh Chawla, VP of Engineering at Zephyr</p> </div> </div>

        <p>DevOps is a set of practices that automates the processes between software development and IT teams, in order that they can build, test, and release software faster and more reliably. The concept of DevOps is founded on building a culture of collaboration between teams that historically functioned in relative siloes. The promised benefits&nbsp;include increased trust, faster software releases, ability to solve critical issues quickly, and better manage unplanned work.</p> 
        <p>At Atlassian, DevOps is the next most famous portmanteau (combining of two words) next to Brangelina (Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie), bringing together the best of software development and IT operations. And like our jokes, it requires some explaining.&nbsp;</p> </div> 
        <h4 class="t20 text-left">At its essence, DevOps is a culture, a movement, a philosophy. </h4> 
        <div class="text-left"> <p>It's a firm handshake between development and operations that emphasizes a&nbsp;shift in mindset, better collaboration, and tighter&nbsp;integration. It&nbsp;unites&nbsp;agile,&nbsp;continuous delivery, automation, and much more, to help development and&nbsp;operations teams&nbsp;be&nbsp;more efficient, innovate faster, and deliver higher value to businesses and customers.</p>
