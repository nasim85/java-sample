<h2>What is DevOps</h2>
  <p>DevOps is a set of practices that automates the processes between software development and IT teams, in order that they can build, test, and release software faster and more reliably. The concept of DevOps is founded on building a culture of collaboration between teams that historically functioned in relative siloes. The promised benefits include increased trust, faster software releases, ability to solve critical issues quickly, and better manage unplanned work.

At Atlassian, DevOps is the next most famous portmanteau (combining of two words) next to Brangelina (Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie), bringing together the best of software development and IT operations. And like our jokes, it requires some explaining. 

At its essence, DevOps is a culture, a movement, a philosophy.

It's a firm handshake between development and operations that emphasizes a shift in mindset, better collaboration, and tighter integration. It unites agile, continuous delivery, automation, and much more, to help development and operations teams be more efficient, innovate faster, and deliver higher value to businesses and customers.77</p>
